# Poverty-and-Academic-Success overview

The purpose of this repository is mainly to showcase python and pandas skills involving merging, grouping, cleaning, etc that are required for working with data

This repository provides a multidimensitonal analysis on how poverty affects test scores alongside other variables. 

Questions include:

-How does poverty affect academic performance across elementary, middle and high schoolers?

-How do these findings change when looking at specific kinds of tests, like math or reading

-How do math and reading scores change as a child develops, when taking poverty into account?

-What role do Charter Schools play when analyzing poverty/preformance relationships

All of the code, variable meanings, results and interpretations will be included in the Jupyter notebook attatched to the repository, however more analysis will be included in this read_me file as well.

Main Findings(more analysis can be found within code explinations)

-Poverty has a large effect on test scores

-As children develop, math scores get progressively worse while writing scores get progressively better

-Charter schools in the same economic circumstance as similar non-charter schools do not have significantly better test scores

All of the data used found from the California Assesment of Student Preformance and Progress(CAASPP)
