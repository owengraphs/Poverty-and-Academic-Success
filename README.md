# Test-Scores-and-What-Affects-Them

**Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to see how economic circumstances affect academic sucess when taking into consideration effects such as grade level, charter schools, math proficency and reading proficency

**Data Used:
The data used is from the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress(CAASPP)

**Overview of how analysis is conducted:

The independent variable is the percentage of students who meet or exceed basic testing standards given by the CAASPP.

The dependent variable measuring economic circumstance is the percentage of students at a given school who are eligible for free lunch. While this is not a perfect estimate due to a wide range of factors(not always entirely accurate at predicting actual income distribution within a school, does not take into account other economic factors that may impact a school, etc). This data, unlike income per student or income per school, is available for most schools in California, and provids more data to measure. As a disclamer, this is of course not intended to stigmatize schools with a free lunch programm, instead this serves to show how economic circumstances affect a students ability to preform.
