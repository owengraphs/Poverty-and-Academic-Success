# Test-Scores-and-What-Affects-Them

The purpose of this repository is mainly to showcase python and pandas skills involving merging, grouping, cleaning, etc that are required for working with lots of data(in this case I am measuring poverty within thousands of schools of schools and tens of thousands of invidivual entries/rows)

What this repository is studying is how poverty affects academic preformance. The questions I ask are:

-How does poverty affect academic preformance across elementary schoolers, middle schoolers and high schoolers?

-How do these findings change when looking at specific kinds of tests, like math or reading

-How do math and reading scores change as a child develops, when taking poverty into account?

-What role do Charter Schools play when analyzing poverty/preformance relationships

All of the code, variable meanings, results and interpretations will be included in the Jupyter notebook attatched to the repository, however more analysis will be included in this read_me file as well.

Main Findings:

-Poverty has a large effect on test scores

-As children develop, math scores get progressively worse while writing scores get progressively better

-Charter schools in the same economic circumstance as similar non-charter schools do not have significantly better test scores

Where I found my data:
All of the data used found from the California Assesment of Student Preformance and Progress(CAASPP)

My data on percentage of students eligble for free lunch(my rough poverty estimate) can be found by following the link below and downloading the "Unduplicated Student Poverty – Free or Reduced-Price Meals Data 2023–24" excel file

My data on test scores can be found by clicking the link below and downloading the csv file for "2023–24 California Statewide research file, All Students, fixed width"
